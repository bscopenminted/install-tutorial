# OMTD Install Tutorial event

## Practical information

* **Place**: ARC, Athens, Grece.
* **Date**: 15 and 16 October 2018.
* **Contact**: Robert Bossy

## Goals

The objective of this tutorial is to give future contributors a better insight on the OpenMinTeD services architecture and internal workings. The format of this event will be hackathon/practical class in order to promote a hands-on approach.

Attendees will install the OpenMinTeD services modules and deploy them in their own servers. The process will allow them to grasp fully the architecture of OpenMinTeD, to give them the opportunity to get answers to technical questions, and to reveal points where they might contribute.

Note that the instances of OpenMinTeD installed during this event are not meant to provide text-mining services to the public. They rather serve as a test bed to each participant and potential contributor.

## Prerequisites

### Skills

This event is going to be technical and thus requires attendees to be familiar with the following activities and tools:

* Linux system administration
* Application containers
* Python

### Hardware

OpenMinTeD services requires a heavy hardware configuration. Please ensure you have a proper [set of servers](https://github.com/openminted/install-tutorial/blob/master/hardware-requirements.md) before attending.

### Software

TBD.
