# Tutorial expectations

This list presents the expectations of attendees for the tutorial.
Keep in mind this is a like a wish list, feel free to add more or to point at unmeetable expectations.

- know of which different pieces of software / services
  the OMTD platform consists and where their sourcecode
  is hosted;
- know which dependencies the different modules have
  (e.g. database, UI libraries, etc.) in order to have an idea
  what kinds of skill sets are required by new OMTD platform 
  developers;
- know where the documentation (installation instructions,
  user manual, developer manual, whatever is available)
  for each of the services/modules is.
- be able to install the entire OMTD platform on a single 
  physical machine (the participant should have done this 
  once during the meeting either on a laptop or remotely
  accessible server); not really possible, though a minimal hardware setup, see: [hardware requirements](hardware-requirements.md);
- have used this installation to build and run a pipeline;
- know where log files are written;
- know where data is written (filesystem, databases, etc.) 
  i.e. which data needs to be backed up;
- know how to deploy and configure content connectors (*e.g.* CORE and
  OpenAIRE);
- know how to load the modules into a development environment
  like Eclipse or IntelliJ, how to make modifications to the
  code, recompile, run and interatively debug the code;
- having been introduced into how to run the platform
  distributed over multiple servers / VMs, although this
  shouldn't need be actually done during the workshop;
